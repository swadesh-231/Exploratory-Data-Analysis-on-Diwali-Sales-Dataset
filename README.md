# Exploratory Data Analysis on Diwali Sales Dataset

## Introduction
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Diwali Sales dataset to uncover valuable insights, identify patterns, and understand the data's underlying structure. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical analysis, and various visualizations.

## Dataset
The dataset includes sales data during the Diwali festival, containing various features such as User ID, Customer Name, Product ID, Gender, Age, Marital Status, State, Zone, Occupation, Product Category, Orders, and Amount.

## Objectives
- Clean the dataset by handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns.
- Perform statistical analysis to understand the data distribution.
- Visualize the data to identify patterns and relationships.
- Derive insights to help in strategic decision-making.

## Steps to Perform EDA
1. **Load the dataset**: Import necessary libraries and load the dataset.
2. **Understand the dataset**: Display the first few rows and get dataset information.
3. **Clean the dataset**: Handle missing values and remove duplicates.
4. **Basic statistical analysis**: Get descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
5. **Visualize the data**: Use various plots for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
6. **Identify patterns and insights**: Group data by relevant categories and analyze aggregated metrics.

## Visualization Techniques
- Histograms for univariate analysis.
- Scatter plots for bivariate analysis.
- Correlation matrix heatmaps.
- Bar plots for aggregated metrics.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Conclusion
The EDA performed on the Diwali Sales dataset provides valuable insights into sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance during the Diwali festival. These insights can help businesses make informed decisions to optimize sales strategies.
